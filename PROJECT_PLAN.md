# Project Plan: Pool Maintenance App

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the features and actionable tasks for developing a Pool Maintenance App. The goal is to create a system that helps users manage their pool's maintenance schedule, chemical balance, and supplies.

**Assumed Technology Stack (Placeholder):**
*   **Backend:** Python (Django or Flask)
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Potentially a simple framework like Vue.js or React for enhanced UI)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL or SQLite

    *   [ ] **Task 2.3.2:** Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations on maintenance tasks.
    *   [ ] **Task 2.3.3:** Implement logic for handling recurring tasks (e.g., auto-generating next due date upon completion).
    *   [ ] **Task 2.3.4:** Create UI to add/edit a maintenance task (including frequency options).
    *   [ ] **Task 2.3.5:** Create UI to display upcoming and overdue tasks for a pool.
    *   [ ] **Task 2.3.6:** Create UI to mark tasks as complete.
    *   [ ] **Task 2.3.7:** Write unit tests for task scheduling logic (creation, completion, recurrence).

### 2.4. Chemical Reading Logs
*   **Description:** Allow users to log and track chemical readings for their pools.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Task 2.4.1:** Design database schema for chemical readings (e.g., pool_id, date_recorded, ph_level, chlorine_level, alkalinity_level, calcium_hardness, cyanuric_acid, notes).
    *   [ ] **Task 2.4.2:** Implement API endpoints for logging new chemical readings.
    *   [ ] **Task 2.4.3:** Implement API endpoints for retrieving historical chemical readings for a pool.
    *   [ ] **Task 2.4.4:** Create UI form to submit new chemical readings.
    *   [ ] **Task 2.4.5:** Create UI to display a history of chemical readings (table or simple chart).
    *   [ ] **Task 2.4.6:** Write unit tests for logging and retrieving chemical readings.

### 2.5. Supply/Inventory Tracking (Basic)
*   **Description:** Allow users to track common pool supplies.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Task 2.5.1:** Design database schema for supplies (e.g., user_id, item_name, current_quantity, desired_quantity, unit, notes).
    *   [ ] **Task 2.5.2:** Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations on supply items.
    *   [ ] **Task 2.5.3:** Create UI to add/edit supply items.
    *   [ ] **Task 2.5.4:** Create UI to display current inventory.
    *   [ ] **Task 2.5.5:** Write unit tests for supply tracking CRUD operations.

### 2.6. Notifications & Reminders (Basic)
*   **Description:** Notify users about upcoming maintenance tasks or low inventory.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Task 2.6.1:** Design mechanism for triggering notifications (e.g., daily cron job checking for due tasks or low supplies).
