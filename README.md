# Pool-Maintenance-App

Create a mobile app for a maintenance company to manage service locations and tasks. The app should:
Display a list of service locations with addresses.
Show tasks for each location, categorized as 'Maintenance' or 'Reorders'.
Allow users to mark tasks as 'To Do', 'In Progress', or 'Completed'.
Enable adding and viewing notes for each task.
Track estimated and actual hours worked on tasks.
Include a section to upload photos related to tasks.
create and edit custom fields for tasks with default entries optional
save and edit task templates
create recurring tasks either selectable schedules
create a tab for scheduling that will allow assigning employees to locations to default tasks to them based on location/date of the task and allow for easy schedule changing if for example an employee moves to new locations
This app will streamline our daily workflow and task management at each location.
